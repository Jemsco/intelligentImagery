  ISO: "When light from an image falls on a camera sensor it is collected by a matrix of small potential wells called pixels. In each pixel there will be a light sensitive element which can sense how many photons have arrived at that particular location. The image is divided into these small discrete pixels. The information from these photosites is collected, organized, and transferred to a monitor to be displayed. As the charge output from each location is proportional to the intensity of light falling onto it, it becomes possible to reproduce the scene as the photographer originally saw it. ISO settings have a direct influence on the amplifier before the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC): high ISO numbers give more amplification, while low ISO numbers give less amplification. The camera sensor itself always maintains the same degree of sensitivity; only the level of amplification changes. Analog-to-digital conversion is an electronic process in which a continuously variable (analog) signal is changed, without altering its essential content, into a multi-level (digital) signal.",
  ASA: "Silver chloride (AgCl), silver bromide (AgBr) and silver iodide (AgI) are the three silver halide compounds used in photography. The light sensitivity of the silver halides is key to the photographic process. Tiny crystals of all three of these compounds are used in making photographic film. When exposed to light, a chemical reaction darkens the film to produce an image.",
